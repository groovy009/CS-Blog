# Challenges

Since my experience with LeetCode until this point has been extremely limited, I have decided to start out my going through LeetCode's provided study plan for technical interviews found here: [https://leetcode.com/study-plan/leetcode-75/?progress=xsnmm3fe](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/leetcode-75/?progress=xsnmm3fe)

There are three levels included in this plan; however, the final level is locked behind a premium subscription, so I will be sticking to the first two. At LeetCode's recommended pace, it should take around 35 days to complete the first 2 levels. I will be completing all of the challenges in C++.
