# Day 4: New Swift Resources

Today I came across a new apple Swift developer tutorial; one that has an estimated completion time of 4hr 25min as opposed to the 14hr 20min completion time of the course I am currently working on.

I figure I can knock this course out today and see if the tools I learn from it make me confident enough to start building my anagrams app. See you on the other side!
