# Day 3: Picking Up the Pace

## Catch-up

I have been away from my blog for a few days because life stops for nobody; however, I have not stopped my progress! In the time since the last post I have received my Mac, secured a summer job, and have begun applying for summer of 2024 internships.&#x20;

A lot of my time has been put towards applications and research about various companies and the positions they offer. My goal has been to not only apply to companies, but also reach out to real people from those companies about my interest in working there.&#x20;

With of early applications (hopefully) comes early interviews; and, to prepare, I have started another page on this website about my LeetCode journey and my solutions to various challenges. You can find that page here:&#x20;

## Swift Progress

Throughout the past few days, I have also been completing the free apple swift course here: [https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training)

Right now, it is definitely helping me grasp the fundamentals of the language and how to incorporate the backend code with UI. However, I feel at a certain point in this course, I will start to experience diminishing returns as the latter sections may be more in-depth than I need for my anagrams game.&#x20;

For the time being, I am continuing my work on this course until i feel comfortable enough with the language to begin my own project. At the same time, I will be continuing to make diagrams and design the backend to post here; along with swift updates.&#x20;

### Other swift resources:

After I have gotten more comfortable with Swift through the Apple Developer tutorial, I would like to watch this video to round off my knowledge and make sure I am extra confident before starting my app: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ojC6TNwws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ojC6TNwws). This should only take a few hours.

I have also looked at this Coursera course by Meta for iOS development: [https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-ios-developer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-ios-developer). However, I do not feel that taking the time to complete this course will benefit me enough. Along with LeetCode, internship applications, and my summer job, I want to save as much time as possible to complete my app before the end of the summer.
