# Plan

For this summer (2023), my ultimate goal is to code and publish an anagrams app that functions much like the one on GamePigeon. However, this app will be a single player experience and will not require the use of iMessage.

Very basic skeleton code written in C++ for the command line is on my github: [https://github.com/groovy009/Anagrams](https://github.com/groovy009/Anagrams)
