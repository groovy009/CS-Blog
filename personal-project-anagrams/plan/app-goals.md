# App Goals

## Essential goals:

When the user hits play, they will be given an assortment of letters they must rearrange to form as many words as possible in a 60 second timeframe.&#x20;

A scoring system should be implemented so that longer words score more points.

Players should be able to see their previous scores and previous answers to different puzzles.

Players should be able to choose the amount of random letters they are given to make new words with (most likely no less than 4 however).

## Future goals:

As well as having an extensive bank of possible letter combinations the user can find, I would like to have a daily challenge that is a bit harder and new each day.

It would be nice to be able to add friends  to see their scores or challenge them to see who gets the higher score.

Could have a sentence mode?
