# What I need to do

1. XCode is only available for mac computers, so I will have to download an instance of MacOS through VM VirtualBox and code there.
2. Watch a tutorial/take a class on the XCode programming environment and Swift language. This 3.5 hour video looks promising: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ojC6TNwws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ojC6TNwws) However, I may also take apple's iOS appDev tutorial found here: [https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/)
3. Once I have a grip of the Swift language and the XCode interface, it's time to start coding. The very bare bones of the project originally coded as a command line application in C++ can be found of my github: [https://github.com/groovy009/Anagrams](https://github.com/groovy009/Anagrams)
4. After completing my app, all that's left is to register an iOS distribution provisioning profile and certificate so I can submit my app to the Apple App store.
