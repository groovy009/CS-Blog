# Bandit

This is where I keep solutions to bandit overthewire challenges. I have completed all of them, and I am in the process of going through the challenges again and posting my solutions.&#x20;

Below is the command used to connect to the bandit servers.

```
$ ssh -p 2220 bandit.labs.overthewire.org -l bandit<number>
```
