# Wave a Flag

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot (6).png>)

In order to download the program, I right clicked on the link and copied the link address. Afterwards I used wget and pasted the address, which downloaded the file to my computer.

I then used chmod to let myself execute the file, and from there getting the flag was very easy.
